# Step 3: Configure Amazon S3 Storage and Events

### Objective

In this step, you will create an S3 bucket to store images and configure Amazon S3 to automatically send a notification to the SQS queue created in the previous step whenever a new image is uploaded.

---

### 3.1 - Create an S3 Bucket

1. Open **Amazon S3**, then choose **Create bucket**.

2. Name the bucket using the format **logistics-raw-images-&lt;your-name&gt;**.

The bucket name must be globally unique across AWS.

3. Select the **ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)** Region because it is close to Vietnam.

### 3.2 - Allow S3 to Send Notifications to SQS

1. Open the **SQS Console** and select the **image-processing-queue** queue.

2. Open the **Access policy** tab and edit the policy.

3. Add a policy that allows S3 to send messages to SQS.

Example policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "s3.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:ap-southeast-1:<account-id>:image-processing-queue",
      "Condition": {
        "ArnLike": {
          "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::logistics-raw-images-<your-name>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace **&lt;account-id&gt;** with your AWS Account ID and replace **logistics-raw-images-&lt;your-name&gt;** with the bucket name you created.

### 3.3 - Configure S3 Event Notification

1. Open the bucket you created, go to the **Properties** tab, scroll to **Event notifications**, then choose **Create event notification**.

2. Name the event **new-image-uploaded**.

3. In **Event types**, select **s3:ObjectCreated:***.

4. In **Prefix/Suffix**, enter image suffixes such as **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, and **.png** so the event only triggers when image files are uploaded.

This configuration helps ignore non-image files such as `.txt` or `.pdf`.

5. In **Destination**, choose **SQS Queue**, then select **image-processing-queue**.
