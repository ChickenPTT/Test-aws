# Step 1: Prepare an IAM Role for Lambda

### Introduction

An IAM Role defines the permissions that Lambda uses to access the AWS services required in this workshop, such as Amazon S3, Amazon SQS, Amazon Rekognition, and Amazon Textract.

In this step, you will create an IAM Role for Lambda and attach the required policies so Lambda can read data, receive messages, and write logs while processing images.

### Implementation Steps

1. Open the **AWS Console** and search for the **IAM** service.

2. Select **Roles**, then choose **Create role**.

3. In **Trusted entity type**, select **AWS service**.

4. In **Use case**, select **Lambda**, then choose **Next**.

6. Name the role **Lambda-ImageProcessing-Role**, then choose **Create role**.

### Security Note

In a real production environment, instead of using broad AWS managed policies, you should write a **Custom Policy** that limits access to only the specific bucket, queue, and services required by the application.

This follows the **Least Privilege** security best practice: grant only the permissions that are necessary and avoid excessive access.
